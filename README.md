# Ghost Shell

**Ghost Shell: A Linux Malware Dropper**

Ghost Shell is a proof-of-concept (POC) malware dropper designed specifically for Linux systems. A malware dropper is a type of malicious program or software that is engineered to deliver and install other types of malware on a target system. The primary objective of a malware dropper is to evade detection and bypass security measures by employing various delivery methods, such as email attachments, malicious links, drive-by downloads, or infected software updates.

**Current Functionality:**
- Ghost Shell currently downloads the payload from a hardcoded website.
- It performs basic checks to ensure the system is running Linux and verifies if the payload file already exists.
- The dropper hides its process to avoid detection.

**Future Enhancements:**
- Advanced evasion techniques, such as Shared Object (SO) Process Injection, will be integrated to enhance its stealth capabilities.
- Obfuscation methods and other types of evasion tactics will be explored to make detection more challenging.

**Important Notes:**
- This is a simple POC dropper intended solely for educational purposes.
- There is no actual payload included in this version.
- Use responsibly and ethically. The author takes no responsibility for any malicious actions performed using this code.
