# Ghost Shell

Ghost Shell is a dropper coded for linux. A malware dropper is a type of malicious program or software that is designed to deliver and install other types of malware on a target system. The primary purpose of a malware dropper is to evade detection and bypass security measures by using different delivery methods, such as email attachments, malicious links, drive-by downloads, or infected software updates. Currently Ghost Shell downloads the payload from a hardcoded website.In the future methods of evasion,such as "SO(shared object)Process Injection" will be added. There is no means of obfuscation or other types of evasion. This is a simple POC dropper. This is only for educational purposes, hence there is no payload. Use responsibly, I take no responsibilty for malicous actions.
